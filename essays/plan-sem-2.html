					After the debacle that was "The Plan (Dec 2022)", I've realized that I cannot rush into things. I'll have to be patient & disciplined, and let things take their own course. So, here I describe the plan for the next semester.

						Now, I know what you must be thinking... Maybe I'm repeating the same mistake again. I'm stacking too much in my plate! But the way I look at it is as follows:
						<ul>
							<li class="lead">
								I'm only effectively studying five subjects - I don't think research writing will takeup too much of my time; and with all the sit-through courses, I can cherry pick interesting/useful topics and ignore the rest.
							</li>
							<li class="lead">
								All throughout my 1st semester, I would roam the campus searching for a place to study. Now that, that problem has been solved, I won't be wasting time wandering the halls of IIT Delhi.
							</li>
							<li class="lead">
								I spent a large part of my first semester: dealing with COVID-induced confusion, grappling with emotional baggage, settling down in a new place, setting up my work environment, and coming to terms with my new outlook towards life & people. My mind was too pre-occupied to focus on my research; Now I know the way forward!
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p class="lead">
						The only way I achieve all this is if I set my mind right! Nothing, absolutely nothing, takes priority over my work - no girls, no friends, no casual family affairs, no external expectations, no nothing!

						<b>[4 Jan, 2022]</b>: I think a part of me always knew why "the Professor" was hesitant to mentor me. Today, he finally laid out the truth; he said "Ugh... what concerns me is your background. (a short pause) You're from mechanical engineering right! If you have inclanation towards mechanical engineering, then you should talk to professors from the mechanical department."

						So, what now? I have always believed that NLP is far from solved because it's only computer science engineers who've been working on this problem. Language is a natural phenomenon, and you need people who have their minds tuned to understanding such processes to solve NLP. Therefore, I think I'll have to solve NLP by myself.

					<p class="lead">
						<b>[7 Jan, 2022]</b>: So, how do I go about solving NLP? Step One: build strong foundations. One way of doing this is to do a thorough study of the entire subject from the get go. This approach may seem optimal at first but comes with a lot of downsides, especially in the short-term. I'll have to optimize for both short-term and long-term; I'll have to study the topics superficially, then deepen my understaning over time - similar to how a pavement is laid!
