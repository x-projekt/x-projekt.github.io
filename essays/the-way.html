					What kind of emotional baggage, you say? Thee years of severe [clinical] depression couples with two years of isolation has made me numb to a lot of indulgences that I used to enjoy. The things that used to stir my soul, now seem aloof... I miss mourining Ghost's death and seeking revenge for Shepard's betrayel, I miss Craig Armstrong's melody piercing my heart while I watch Gatsby die in Daisy's love, I miss being abducted by my imagination and taken away to a far away galaxy hoping to unravel the meaning of life, and God... I miss my Captain, Oh Captain my Captain!
				</p>
				<p class="lead">
					All my sensitivity and compassion... gone! I almost feel like I'm a dead man walking. At times it feels like the universe made me pay an unfairly steep price for genuinely loving someone.

					Emroiled with a sense of loss, I spent a most of my 1st semseter at IIT Delhi trying to revive myself, albeit in vein. It took me all this time to realize that I've been thinking about my circumstance all wrong. And it is now that I've learned to appreciate all the pain, hardship, and reckoning that Stephen Colbert had gone through, when he said <mark>"What punishments of God are not gifts?"</mark>
				</p>
				<p class="lead">
					I've realized that all I have lost are the purposeless indulgances that were leeching off of my time, and the truth is - I've gained everything and lost nothing! I used to spend a lot of time, often days on end, thinking about all the ways life could turn-out. And in retrospect, all I did was... think! And with all the futile habits out of my way, I have gained <em>time</em>, which I can now use to fulfill my purpose. What purpose, you say? I don't want to think it, I want to do it - and this is where my vocation comes in!

					So, what am I doing with all the new found time?... Girls! I think God created them to keep men from realizing their potential, for history doesn't remember men with power so favourably. Everytime I talk to a girl I like, I feel a sharp pang of conscience asking me - <mark>"What is the purpose of you life?"</mark> and in response... I freeze.
				</p>
				<p class="lead">
					I have thought about this question for almost 20 years of my life. Why do I exist? What is my purpose? And I think I have zeroed in on a train of thought which might answer the question. (<small class="text-muted">Why "might answer the question" and not "will answer the question"? we'll get to that later.</small>)

					<strong>Think</strong>: It would help to start with animals, after all humans are animals to begin with. Every single living organism that ever existed on this planet, had a singular purpose - to ensure the long-term survival of its species. Everything that these organisms do, and everything that happens to them (all external stimuli), from the moement they are born till the moment they die, is aimed at ultimately fulfilling this purpose. And all this life-long effort culminates in the single act of reproduction - being healthy enough to survive, have off-springs, and maybe even raise them. But who decides the rules of this game? Simple, its Nature, and the phenomenon of evolution is the manifestation of these rules. For the non-science people out there, these rules can be summed-up in a single phrase - <mark>"Survival of the Fittest"</mark>

					Absolute discipline: you don't feel anything (no anger, no sadness, no happiness, no highs, no lows) unless you want to, you don't say anything you don't want to, you don't think anything unless you want to, nothing outside of yourself effects you (good food, what's that? heat, cold, comfy - I don't know what that means) - but you do listen and observe. Every cell in your body must fall in line, Every part of your being is aimed at the singular purpose of your life.
