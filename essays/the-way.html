					Although, it seems like I've lost a lot, the truth is - I've gained everything and lost nothing! What do I mean by that? I spent a lot of time, often days on end, thinking about all the ways life could turn-out. And in retrospect, all I did was... think! And with all the purposeless indulgences out of the way, I have gained <em>time</em>, which I can now use to move towards my purpose. What purpose? I don't want to think it, I want to do it - and this is where my vocation comes into the picture!
