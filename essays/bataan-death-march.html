					It was on 26th of June, 2020, that I discovered my vocation. Since, then my journey has been anyting but easy - studying subjects from core Computer Science and Mathematics all by myself, with no external-pressure (<small class="text-muted">the kind you're subjected to at college</small>) and no peer-group to collaborate/compare your progress with, all the while dealing with severe depression. To make matters worse, it was the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic and I had to isolate in my room. Everyday for the next two years, I spent my entire day fighting a war in my mind - with the sole aim of establishing peace!

					Despite all that was going on with my mind, my gut seemed to have been working just fine. I say that because it kept telling me - "<em>... you have to find your way back to academia, son!</em>". And so I did, after being rejected by Stanford University (<small class="text-muted">I wanted to pursue M.S. in <a href="https://symsys.stanford.edu/">Symbolic Systems</a>; god! that program was perfect for me</small>), I got admission at the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi in the newly established Yardi School of Artificial Intelligence.

                    The timing for this so-perfect (<small class="text-muted">in fact, I am part of its first cohort of Master's students at this school!</small>). I joined the program on 26th August, 2022.

                    Although, my life seemed to be turning around (<small class="text-muted">this time for good</small>),  I quickly realized that I still hadn't conqured my mind and to make matters worse the environment at [IIT] Delhi offered a lot more challenges than I had anticipated...
