					Although getting into IIT Delhi was a ray of hope for me, my journey here didn't exactly start off the way I hoped it would. I am still carrying some emotional baggage from the three-year long "<a href="./bataan-death-march.html">Bataan Death March</a>". And the environment at [IIT] Delhi is providing additional challenges, that I did not anticipate.

					What kind of emotional baggage, you say? Thee years of severe [clinical] depression coupled with two years of isolation has made me numb to a lot of indulgences that I used to enjoy. Things that used to stir my soul, now seem aloof... I miss mourining Ghost's death and seeking revenge for Shepard's betrayel, I miss Craig Armstrong's melody piercing my heart while I watch Gatsby die in Daisy's love, I miss being abducted by my imagination and taken away to a far away galaxy hoping to unravel the meaning of life, and God... I miss being a hopeless romantic!
				</p>
				<p class="lead">
					All my sensitivity and compassion... gone! I almost feel like I'm a dead man walking. At times it feels like the universe made me pay an unfairly steep price for genuinely loving someone.
				</p>
				<p class="lead">
					Emroiled with this sense of loss, I spent most of my 1st semseter at IIT Delhi trying to revive myself, albeit in vein. It took me all this time to realize that I've been thinking about my circumstance all wrong. And it is now that I've learned to appreciate all the pain, hardship, and reckoning that Stephen Colbert had gone through, when he said <mark>"What punishments of God are not gifts?"</mark>
				</p>
				<p class="lead">
					I've realized that all I have lost are the purposeless indulgances that were leeching off of my time, and the truth is - I've gained everything and lost nothing! I used to spend a lot of time, often days on end, thinking about all the ways life could turn-out. And in retrospect, all I did was... think! And with all the futile habits out of my way, what I've gained is - time! I can now use it to fulfill my purpose. What purpose, you say? - this is where my [new-found] vocation comes in!

					Despite knowing what I must be doing, I am currently running bootless errands. What?... Girls! I think God created them to keep men from realizing their potential, for history doesn't remember men with power so favourably. Everytime I talk to a girl I like, I feel a sharp pang of conscience asking me - <mark>"What is the purpose of you life?"</mark> and in response... I freeze.
				</p>
				<p class="lead">
					Why am I getting distracted by girls? long story short... fear! Given my age, I'm afraid I might never find a partner. The issue is not finding a girl, there are lots of girls; the issue is finding the right girl! This might sound like a cliche, but there is infact something called the right-partner - someone whose mind resonates with that of yours. Ugh... Now, what do I mean by "resonating minds"? I think <a href="https://qr.ae/pGapCv">this post on Quora</a> explains it better. <b>TLDR;</b> the more intelligent a person gets, the more difficult it becomes for them to form meaningful connections with others, owing to something called the "Communication Range". So, highly-intelligent men are blessed with an exceptional mind, but are cursed with a life of solitude.
				</p>
				<p class="lead">
					So, am I claiming that I'm exceptionally intelligent? Well, going off of Einstein's definition of intelligence, I think, I am! And I only seem to reinforce this opinion the more I talk to other people; at the risk of sounding like a narcissistic douche, I must admit that most people have pretty boring minds (<small class="text-muted">If you can get your hands on a time-machine, you should endavour to ask <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedy_Lamarr">Hedy Lamarr</a> her opinion on peoples' minds.</small>).
