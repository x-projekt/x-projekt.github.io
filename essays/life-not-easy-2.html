					<strong>Think</strong>: It would help to start with animals, after all humans are animals to begin with. Every single living organism that ever existed on this planet, had a singular purpose - to ensure the long-term survival of its species. Everything that these organisms do, and everything that happens to them (all external stimuli), from the moement they are born till the moment they die, is aimed at ultimately fulfilling this purpose. And all this life-long effort culminates in the single act of reproduction - being healthy enough to survive, have off-springs, and maybe even raise them. But who decides the rules of this game? Simple, its Nature, and the phenomenon of evolution is the manifestation of these rules. For the non-science people out there, these rules can be summed-up in a single phrase - <mark>"Survival of the Fittest"</mark>

					Getting into IIT Delhi was a ray of hope for me, however it seems that I have over-estimated my state-of-mind. I am still carrying some emotional baggage from the three-year long "<a href="./bataan-death-march.html">Bataan Death March</a>". And the environment at [IIT] Delhi is providing additional challenges, that I did not anticipate.

					Absolute discipline: you don't feel anything (no anger, no sadness, no happiness, no highs, no lows) unless you want to, you don't say anything you don't want to, you don't think anything unless you want to, nothing outside of yourself effects you (good food, what's that? heat, cold, comfy - I don't know what that means) - but you do listen and observe. Every cell in your body must fall in line, Every part of your being is aimed at the singular purpose of your life.
