						I accept the truth, i.e. the only "laws" in this world are the ones dictated by nature. And forgoe everything else, especially and  including the laws made by humans to ensure harmony amongst the common-folk and the supremacy of the few in power. I will disavow concepts/ideas like ethics, religious dogma, the institution of marriage, external expectations, social etiquette, cultural/societal norms and traditions, and just about every possible variation of these ideas.
					</p>
					<p class="lead">
						I'll need power to put this to practice. And fortunately, I think I have all the knowledge, and skill needed to pursue this path; but I'm lacking one crucial ingredient - discipline! It doesn't matter how skilled or talented I am, without discipline I'm nothing. And, inculcating this discipline (<small class="text-muted">especiall now, after all that I've gone through!</small>) will make me suffer in the short-term, but I <i>might</i> enjoy (<small class="text-muted">quite a lot</small>) in the long-term.
					</p>
					<p class="lead">
						Honestly, I think this is the path I should take; in fact, I think even the universe wants me to take this path - every time I think about this, it just feels right. However, my fear of failure is making me choose for the local-optimum instead of striving for the global optimum. And to be fair, I think this fear is not totally mis-placed, either; This option is risky, I will have to give my absolute all, and falling-short is not an option, because I stand to lose everything.

						I deliberatly dumb-down myself in-order to fit in. This might help in the short-run, but I will definitely suffer in the long run. And to be honest, I think this is what I've been upto for the past two years; and it hasn't served me well. And all throughout, I have experienced sharp pangs of conscience asking me - <mark>"What is the purpose of you life?"</mark>

						Discussing this question can get quite involved, and deserves its own section: <a href="#truth">The Truth!</a>

					<strong>Think</strong>: It would help to start with animals, after all humans are animals to begin with. Every single living organism that ever existed on this planet, had a singular purpose - to ensure the long-term survival of its species. So, given an environment, for any species inhabiting the said environment, the DNA-sequences are culled while keeping only the "<i>best performers</i>", i.e. nature's law says - <mark>"Survival of the fittest"</mark>.

					So, somewhere along the way our primates, evolved a type of cognition that gave them an edge over all the other organisms in the bio-sphere. This cognition eventually led to the creation of the modern human civilization. Therefore, every homo sapien is obliged to develop its cognition, because that is what allowed us to conquer the food-chain.

					Now, "What is the purpose of my life?": to develop my cognition to the best of my abilities and use it for enhancing the state of our civilization.
