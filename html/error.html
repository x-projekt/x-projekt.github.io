        diagnose the issue:

            <li>Refresh the page.</li>
            <li>(<small class="text-muted">if step-1 doesn't work</small>) Try opening this
                link in incognito/private-browsing window. You may copy and paste the URL 
                from	the address bar.
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>(<small class="text-muted">if step-2 works</small>) Clear your 
                    browser Cache and reload the page in a non-incognito window.</li>
                </ol>
